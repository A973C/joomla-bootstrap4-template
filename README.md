# Joomla! Bootstrap4 Template
**A Joomla! 3 Site template for Bootstrap 4 (Alpha 3)**

## About this Joomla! template
Out of the box Joomla! shipps with Bootstrap version 2.
Right now the Bootstrap contributors work on Bootstrap version 4, which is getting closer and closer to be released.
As we like Joomla! and Bootstrap! we wanted to bring the latest versions of both products together.
Therefore we built this template.
The template adds the typical look & feel of Bootstrap 4 to your Joomla! 3 site.
Various components and modules have been integrated into the template. Therefore you don't need to create overrides.
Just install the template and try it out.
